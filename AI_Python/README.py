#1 - Import data
    # ex: import pandas as pd
    #     data_frame = pd.read_csv('players_fifa23.csv')
    #     data_frame.shape
    #     data_frame.describe()
    #     data_frame.values
    # DOC:  https://elitedatascience.com/python-cheat-sheet

#2 - Clean the data
#3 - Split the data, training set/test set
#4 - Create models
#5 - Check the output
#6 - Improve

# Tools : 
#   1)Numpy(arrays)
#   2)Pandas (data analysis)
#   3)Scikit-learn (classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection and preprocessing)
#   4)Matplotlib (visualize data)
#   5)JupiterNoteBook(test the code, gui with ide)
#   6)Kaggle(community, datasets for free)




# Types of machine learning : 
#   1) Supervised ( Classification, Regression )
#   2) UnSupervised ( Clustering, Association rule learning )
#   3) Reinforcement ( Skill acquisition, Real time learning )

# Steps to figure machine learning
#   1) Problem definition : what problem are we trying to solve
#   2) Data : what king of data do we have
#   3) Ã‰valuation : what defines success for us
#   4) Features : what do we already know about the data
#   5) Modelling : based on our problem and data, what model should we use
#   6) Experimentation : how could we improve/what can we try next
